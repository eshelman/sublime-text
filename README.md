sublime-text
============

My personal user settings and snippets for Sublime Text editor. Re-use if you want!

This repo should replace the default Sublime Text user directory (or if you already
have files there, you'll want to merge them). On Linux, that directory should be:

~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User/
